Akka-DDS-Extension
==================

DDS Extension for Akka

This project is part of my Thesis "Quality-of-Service Support in Distributed and Wide-Scale Actor Systems".
You can read more information in RTI blog (http://bit.ly/akkadds).

Scope of the project is to create an Akka Extension to support RTI Connext DDS.

To deploy the code you have to download and install Akka 2.2.4 (http://downloads.typesafe.com/akka/akka-2.2.4.zip),
Scala 2.10.4 (http://www.scala-lang.org/download/all.html), and RTI Connext DDS (http://www.rti.com/downloads/index.html).

To test the extension there are included a simple main publisher class (test/MainPublisher.scala)
and a main subscriber class (test/MainSubscriber.scala).
The publisher will write 100 messages of 128 byte, and the subscriber will log them.

Launch the java command including in the classpath the scala-library.jar,
the jars contained in the akka/lib folder and the nddsjava.jar.

To run the publisher application launch the test/MainPublisher.scala from the console:

java -classpath _include jar files here_ test.MainPublisher

To run the subscriber application launch the test/MainSubscriber.scala from the console:

java -classpath _include jar files here_ test.MainSubscriber

You can deploy them in different nodes, they will communicate through RTI Connect DDS.

Or simply, load the project in the Scala IDE (http://scala-ide.org) for Scala 2.10.4, add the needed jars in the Build Path and create a Run Configuration for the publisher and one for the subscriber.

The folder idl contains the data structures needed for communication generated by rtiddsgen using HelloWorld.idl as input.
